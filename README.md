# Zineprint

Tool for laying out zines to be printed double-sided as booklets. This assumes
you're printing on letter sized paper currently.

I believe for this to work properly the number of pages needs to be divisible
by 4. But I will probably improve how it handles that when all pages would not
be perfectly filled.

My workflow for using this is:

- Draw each page in its own file in procreate using an 5.5"x8.5" (half of letter) size canvas, 300dpi.
- Select all files (including front and back cover) in procreate and export as PDF
- Upload PDF into Zineprint, and submit
- Print odd pages, as many copies as I'd like
- Feed pages back into the printer and print even pages
